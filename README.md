## guac-a-mole

Guac-A-Mole is the guacamole version of the Whack a Mole game.  The user will play a game of whack-a-mole, where the they have to click on every avocado that appears from one of the holes.  Every avocado they hit will turn into guacamole and points will be added to the user. Every round has limited time and the avocados should appear randomly from the holes.

If the user clicks on an avocado, the following will happen:
- The avocado will turn into guacamole, then disappear after some time.
- The user will earn 5 points and they'll be added to the total score.

The duration of one round is 2 minutes and the timer should start when the game screen appears. When only 10 seconds are left, the timer's color must change to red and it must pulse.

When the time is up, the user will be redirected automatically to the score page.
